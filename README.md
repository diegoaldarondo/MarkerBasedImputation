# Marker-Based Imputation

Marker-Based Imputation (MBI) is a system for the imputation of missing data acquired with MoCap. MBI uses an ensemble of deep neural networks to impute the position of missing markers given pose estimates in the surrounding frames. MBI supports LSTM and WaveNet models for time-series forcasting. 

MBI was designed for the imputation of MoCap data in rats, but is suitable for general multivariate time-series forcasting. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
